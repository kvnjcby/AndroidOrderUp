## OrderUp

OrderUp is an experimental Android application designed to investigate the roles that mobile devices could play in increasing the automation, efficiency, and customer satisfaction of restaurants and other similar establishments. In OrderUp, ordering, checkout, client communication, order tracking, and order management are handled in one seamless experience requiring far less manual labor than most restaurants can currently achieve. OrderUp was developed as a final project for COMP 433, Mobile Computing Systems, at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.
